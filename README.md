# Repeat Word Count

##### Counts the number of times an inputted word appears in an inputted string

#### By Casey Heitz

## Description

This application has the user input both a word and a string.  The application searches through the inputted string and counts the number of times the inputted word appears.  It takes the user to a new page to display the count.  Partial matches do not count (e.g. "cathedral" will not count if the inputted word is "cat").  Only one word can be searched for or the user will receive an error message.

## Setup

* Run composer install in Terminal from the project root folder.
* Start the PHP server from Terminal in the /web folder.
* Open a web browser and navigate to "localhost:8000".

## Technologies Used

PHP, PHPUnit, Silex, and Twig.
